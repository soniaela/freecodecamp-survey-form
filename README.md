### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Forms - ultimately, this project was about creating the structure of a form with HTML. 
How to disable the first option of a dropdown menu.
How to create a shape around the form.
How to place a background picture and alter its appearance.


### Continued development

This project is not responsive. This is something I'll have to work on in the future.
